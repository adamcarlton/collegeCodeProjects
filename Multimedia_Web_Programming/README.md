# Multimedia Web Programming

In this course I was exposed to slightly more advanced concepts of creating a web page

## Project 1
This was just a simple web page stating who I was and some basic javascript to add in the current time that is constantly refreshed

## Project 2
This project was slightly more advanced and involved incorporating the google maps API into the page where you could move around the map, find your current location using the geolocation service, and lastly you could select pre-determined locations from a dropdown and the map will jump to the location and place a marker that you can click and have a brief blurb about the location that I hardcoded in

## Project 3
This project was to gain practice using JS canvas to draw things such as basic flowers, a vehicle, and an image

## Project 4
This project was dealing with animation. In this I have a troll sprite move across the screen with the arrow keys and when it reaches a certain point in the canvas a video will play in the bottom portion of the canvas.

## Project 5
This project was similar to a paint program, from a dropdown menu you can select a shape and color and by clicking on the screen or clicking and dragging on the screen, it will draw the shape with the color selected. This project also used caching so that you could leave the page and upon return, all the images that were drawn will remain unless the "clear" button is clicked which will clear the cache.
