# Operating Systems (all projects done in C)
This was probably the hardest class in my major. These projects had us implement OS concepts that we had learned in class

## Project 0
The purpose of this project was to implement our own hashmap and to read in a file of mailing addresses to detect duplicates. The buckets of the hashmap would also be dynamically resized if the bucket hit a certain threshold 

## Project 1
The final outcome of this project is found in thv4.c We created a Priority Queue to implement a round robin scheduler of processes that we created by forking. At the end of this we would output information of the child process by looking at the file system. I had this functionality however I wasn't finding/printing the correct information and was never able to figure out why due to time constraints

## Project 2
This final project was implementing a fake diskdriver. 


### Disclaimer
Some of the functions used are not real C functions. We were not allowed to use the standard library in our code the professor gave us standard functions that he wrote.
