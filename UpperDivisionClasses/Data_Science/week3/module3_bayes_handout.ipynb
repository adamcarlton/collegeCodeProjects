Fow now, you need to do a perspective shift. We will no longer be using a table-based approach that looks at columns of features. Instead we will use counts of things. First, here is the formula we want to compute.\n",

This ends up being the total number of times we see E1 with O divided by the total number of O tweets. If the hashtag #trump appears in every hate tweet, then P(#trump|hate) = 1.

    "All of these probabilities are known to us so we could calculate an answer. Our current approach tries to avoid calculating much at prediction time. Instead we pre-build our dictionary and store the counts there. Computation cost is just look up cost in a Python dictionary (fast). Can we use the same approach with the formula above? We would need a dictionary that contains all possible combinations of hashtags with their counts, i.e., the powerset. We have 23K unique hastags. The size of the powerset is `2**N`. So we are looking at a dictionary with 2**23000 items. Gulp. That's not going to happen. Our alternative is to forget the dictionary and just do on-demand counting for each new tweet and set of hashtags. But this could be slow if we have to search the entire tweet_table multiple times for every new tweet. And if you are an app developer with a cool new tweet-filter, you want this happening in real-time as tweets come in.\n",
    "<p>To get around the space and computational costs of the formula above (the full chain rule), Smith said let's pretend that all terms are independent of each other. Others said, don't be naive, Smith, you can't assume that terms are totally independent. But Smith persevered. And she was right, the naive assumption does work well in many cases. So Naive Bayes is normal Bayes but with the strong (naive) assumption that all items are independent.\n",
