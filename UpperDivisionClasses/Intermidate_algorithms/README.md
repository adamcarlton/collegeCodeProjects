# Intermediate Algorithms (All code done in Java)
This class was my intro to dynamic programming and introduced more complex algorithms than I had previously learned 
Not every project is on here because we only had to code 4 projects, all other assignments were written

## Project 0
This was just a warm up so that we were familiar with basic IO in Java

## Project 2
This project tested if a graph was a Directed Acyclic Graph and implemented Depth First Search (the input was a file with lines of 3 integers, first two integers were classified as nodes with the third integer being the weight). It's been quite a while since I've looked at this code so I can't accurately remember what the desired outcome of this program was.

## Project 5
This project solved the "minimum number of coins for a given value" problem in three different ways. 

The first way is a pure recursive solution

The second way is recursive as well but results are memoized in a hash table

The final way is an iterative solution, results are put in array and calculate from smallest to largest

## Project 6
This last project used dynamic programming to read in a text file with no spaces and writing it back out in a legible format using both memoization and iterative solutions.
