# Intermediate Data Structures (all projects done in Java)

Each project in this class was implementing a different data structure with the exception of HW_Lab0 which created a Greatest Common Denominator function and Least Common Multiple function to get us used to basic input and output in Java

## Project 1
In this project we implemented a Stack, Queue, and a Two Stack Queue in Java using a Node class that held the data we were inserting.

## Project 2
In this project we implemented a Binary Search Tree with insert, delete, and traverse (preorder, postorder, and inorder) functions. For extra credit we were asked to implement a function to compare two binary search trees which you can see at the bottom of BST.java

## Project 3
For this project we were asked to create a MinHeap and a Priority Queue

## Project 4
This last project was to implement an AVL tree 



##### The bulk of the code is found in the files labeled like dataStructure.java | files labeled with HW#.java are for testing
