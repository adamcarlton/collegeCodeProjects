# CollegeCodeProjects
The projects here have been developed throughout my college career that demonstrate my coding Abilities.

There are many more courses I have taken in the Computer Science Department here at the University of Oregon however I do not
feel they are not applicable to modern day industry so I have chosen to leave those out of this repo. 


### Disclaimer
In some of the README's I say "we" when discussing what the project is. This refers to what we as a class had to do for the project. All work is my own unless noted as a comment in my code that I received assistance from a classmate
